"""Overloader is decorator factory for use with classes using the WorkType
metaclass. Function overloading is not implemented in Python like it is in
many other languages. In this particular implementation, the user must
explicitly define the function signature in the decorator. The WorkMeta
provides the classes with logic for identifying function signatures.
